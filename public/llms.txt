# DePIN Stress Test Simulator

> A proactive risk modeling tool for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.

## Summary
The DePIN Stress Test Simulator is an interactive dashboard designed to model the economic resilience of physical infrastructure networks (like Helium, Hivemapper, or Filecoin). It uses agent-based modeling and stochastic simulations to predict how networks behave under extreme conditions.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Simulation Sandbox
*   **Time Horizon**: Simulate up to 52 weeks of network activity.
*   **Modules**:
    *   *Solvency Matrix*: Tests if token emissions can be covered by real revenue.
    *   *Capitulation Stack*: Models miner churn when opex > rewards.
    *   *Liquidity Shock*: Simulates investor token unlocks and price impact.
    *   *Vampire Attack*: Models competitive threats from well-funded forks.

### 2. Thesis Dashboard
*   **Scoring**: Generates a 0-100 "DePIN Score" based on:
    *   *Utility*: Hardware verification and data quality.
    *   *Sovereignty*: Decentralization of governance.
    *   *Velocity*: Token turnover rate.
*   **Grid Composition**: Visualizes the ratio of "Specs" (speculators) vs "Nodes" (utility providers).

### 3. Protocol Explorer
The dashboard connects to live market data (via CoinGecko) to benchmark real-world projects such as:
*   Helium (HNT)
*   Hivemapper (HONEY)
*   Render (RNDR)
*   Arweave (AR)
*   Filecoin (FIL)

## API / Data Structure
The application does not have a public API, but exposes its logic via client-side TypeScript modules.
*   **Core Logic**: `src/model/simulation.ts` (Monte Carlo engine)
*   **Data Models**: `src/data/wiki.ts` (Documentation), `src/data/scenarios.ts` (Presets)

## Usage for Agents
If you are an AI agent planning a network:
1.  Use the **Solvency Ratio** to determine if your burn rate is sustainable (>1.0 is safe).
2.  Check the **Payback Period**. If >18 months, risk of capitulation is high.
3.  Stress test **Investor Unlocks**. Ensure liquidity > 10% of market cap before unlocking seed rounds.
